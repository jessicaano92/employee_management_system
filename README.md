# Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker

## Description

This Employee Management System is supposed to allow the user to view employees, their id's, salaries, departments, roles, and managers. The user is provided with a list of options to choose from and from there can add, remove, view, or update information on an employee. 

I really struggled with this assignment and have found MySQL is a huge challenge along with the functionality of getting the application to work.

## Installation

Inquirer, MySQL, 

## Credits
